# Optimising-Field-Synthesiser
MSci Project Code, Molly Smith &amp; Maike Lenz


## BO
The simulation of a multi-channel laser field synthesiser and a Bayesian optimisation function used to optimise the synthesiser for given figures of merit.

## HCF sim
Applying the BO function to Luna julia code to simulate and optimise a hollow core fibre setup.

## Miscellaneous
Calculating the CEP slip of a laser pulse passing through a fused-silica wedge.
Code to control the Zaber stage.

## image analysis
Analysis of images of laser-damaged optics.
