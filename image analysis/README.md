# Image Analysis
Code used to analyse the images we took of laser-damaged optics.
This contains 4 folders.

## 75mm_lens_setup
The images taken when we had both the optic and the CCD 2f away from the lens.
1) Heating - used a soldering iron to heat the window
2) Intentional damage - laser-damaged glass slides
3) Looking for Damage - no results
4) quick measurements - no results

## Forces
Fourier transform images where we clamped the window and used a force sensor to measure the force acting on the top of the window.

## Logitech
Fourier transform images taken using bad quality camera.

## Mako
Fourier transform images of potentially damaged windows and clearly damaged optics.
